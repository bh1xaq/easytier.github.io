# Public Server Networking

Currently, a small bandwidth public server is provided to facilitate networking for friends without a public server. In most cases, P2P tunneling can be successful. If P2P tunneling fails, the bandwidth between nodes may be relatively low.

The configuration method is shown in the figure.
