# Graphical User Interface (GUI) Networking

The graphical interface program can also be downloaded from the GitHub Release page, with the prefix easytier-gui.

Note that after installation on MacOS, you need to execute the following command in the terminal, otherwise, it will mistakenly report that the file is damaged.

```bash
xattr -c /Applications/easytier-gui.app
```
