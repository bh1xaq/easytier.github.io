# Subnet Proxy

By setting up a subnet proxy, you can connect the local area network and the virtual local area network.

Assuming the devices at home are in the 192.168.1.0/24 subnet, and you want to access any device at home from the company, you can start an EasyTier node at home and add a subnet proxy for 192.168.1.0/24. No additional configuration is needed on the company's devices; simply connect to the home node successfully, and you can access any device at home.
